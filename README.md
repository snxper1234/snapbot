# Snappy Bot
This is **Snappy Bot**

The Discord bot for all your needs, **including...** 

**Moderation commands, Fun commands, Music, and more‚ùó**

## Get the bot on your server
Just invite the bot through these links: 

[Invite (Admin Perms)](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=815126232004821015&permissions=8&scope=bot)

[Invite (Regular Perms (Moderation commands do not work)](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=815126232004821015&permissions=507374838&scope=bot)

After inviting the bot, get the list of commands using `c?help` and have fun using Snappy Bot!

## Why the bot is better
Sure, you have dashboard bots like MEE6 and Dyno, but here's why this bot is better than both!

#### üî® Moderation
The bot doesn't have as much moderation as MEE6, but it still works and the bot is in a development phase, so more commands will be coming soon!

#### üé≤ Fun commands
Both of those bots mainly focus on moderation... we have about 13 fun commands?

#### üéß Music
Listen up, we have tons of music control over here, including pause and play!
